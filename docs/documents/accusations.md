# This documentation will go over what happened on the 7th of Feburary, 2022 regarding "MonkeyTheMonkey" and "Larucus".

Let's go over some things that I believe we can all agree on.

### 1. Everyone is innocent until proven guilty.
If we assume everyone who's accused is instantly guilty, the amount of false accusations would be incredibly high and the power these purposely (or not) accusations would hold would be tremendous, we have to wait until we have solid proof before dealing with people.

### 2. It's almost impossible to prove you didn't do something.
It's often somewhat easy to prove someone did do something, because there will be signs that it happened, but proving that something *didn't* happen is almost impossible, because nothing will suggest it did. I could say that *you*, the reader, tried to buy nudes, and all you could say is "Well, no I didn't", and that's it.

### 3. If you're going to make extremely bold claims, you have to have extremely solid proof.
It's not even nearly enough to take a random member of the community's word for it when dealing with such a severe field of accusations. We'd need solid proof that couldn't have been faked, and isn't just someone's word, but instead, images that clearly show that events take place.

### 4. If you didn't do it, you'll normally deny it.
If you asked someone why they did something, and they did it, they'll try and justify it, "It seemed like the right thing to do", but if you ask someone and they didn't do it, they'll deny doing it, they won't justify doing something they didn't do, "I didn't do that though".

---

Now with these over and done with, let's go over roughly what happened. I've heard a few sides of these stories, and I don't think anyone really has given an objective one, but I'll still try to stay impartial.

A member of the community, we'll call Member A, has messaged Monkey. They have said that Larucus has tried to buy nude images of A, and that they're 16 years old.
This is the main allegation made.
Monkey then joined a voice chat with Larucus and another member of the community, Member B. He then goes on to pronounce these allegations to the group.
Regardless of Larucus's innocence, there's not much he can do apart from deny these bold claims, which he did, like above, you can't prove you didn't do something.
I am messaged by Larucus, alerting me of what has happened regarding Monkey spreading this claim. I am then messaged by Monkey, alerting me of his claim.

I gave Monkey the ultimatum, either provide the proof which would show that Larucus clearly attempted to buy these nude images, or, because of his potentially damaging behaviour, will be removed from the server. Monkey agreed.

He told me he was away from his PC so the proof would come a bit later, and I agreed. It came a few hours later, and the proof that he sent was purely a screenshot showing two individuals talking, and one of them (paraphrased) says "Yeah Larucus bought [my nudes]".

Now, regarding point three from above, the claim he made could be potentially reputationally damaging or ending, and with that, you must also provide the corresponding proof, which in this case would be substantial evidence showing that him ask for them, but this evidence provided shows nothing, there was nothing stopping Member A from completely lying, and like I said above, if we accept random accusations, we wouldn't survive as a server or staff team.

Now, I've often heard the same few questions so I'll answer them here as well:

### Did Monkey even do anything / Did Monkey even spread this information.
1. Larucus messaged me a few minutes prior to Monkey regarding this information, so I know it was discussed.
2. When I asked Monkey why he did it, he simply justified his actions assuring me he'll show the proof.
While there isn't recorded proof that his happened, the circumstances and Monkey agreeing to doing it by justifying it is enough for me.

### You're just trusting Larucus, and banning for no reason
While I do support my staff team, I will never back them for no reason, and this is the case. I'd love to remove bad people from the staff team, so if this is an opportunity, I'd happily that that up.
Why would I want to randomly ban community members, what would I get out of this? Nothing, I have no incentive to do that.

While we don't want to discredit community concerns, if these allegations were to result in being true, shouldn't the goal be to take this a criminal level, rather than telling other civilian community members? This is an incredibly serious matter if true, so why not take it immediately to an admin to get them instantly removed with solid proof, rather than telling random members of the community?

If you have any questions, send me a direct message, I'll be happily to hear your side of the story.
